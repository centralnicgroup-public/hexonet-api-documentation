# ActivateDomainTransfer

## DESCRIPTION
There are several cases where the ActivateDomainTransfer command is used:<br>
1. To activate an incoming transfer of a gTLD which requires the approval of the registrant with the respective trigger code which was sent to the registrant by email.
2. To deny an outgoing transfer request of a gTLDs on behalf of the registrant providing the respective trigger code that was sent to the registrant by email.
3. To activate a change of ownership of a gTLD following the ICANN IRTP process.
4. To activate an incoming transfer of a ccTLD e.g. if a fax form is required. This option is only available for registrars using our RegistrarOC system.

If a gTLD transfer or change of ownership is requested and our system sends an email to the registrant then there are a confirmation link and a trigger code included. This link leads to a white-labelled web site which utilizes the ActivateDomainTransfer command to allow the registrant to either accept or reject the transfer request or to approve the change of ownership.

## AVAILABILITY
All users have access to this command. The command is not available for all TLD's.
